# CS-210-Portfolio-Project
This program reads a list of make, model, years from a csv file then allows a user to input from a list of makes. 
Then filters the the models accordingly and prompts the user to input a model.
Filtering again, and prompts the user for a year.
Selections are then saved to a .txt file.

Some To-Do's. 
Needs error handling for user input. 
Currently there is no system in place for when a user submits data not supported from the CSV data.

Create a GUI interface that places filtered data into a box for the user to click to select from filtered data.
